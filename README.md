Cobalt is an application to view and review your recently played DOTA 2 matches locally on your Android phone. It features customizable graphs, Steam OpenID login, and an always accessible match history..

Master Branch
-------------
The current version of the application. This won't be updated anymore, because I learned new techniques, and want to give the application a better structure under the hood, and actually take time to design the UI (conform Material Design). Will get merged with devel eventually.

Devel Branch
------------
New version of the application, with many features lacking, but way more to come. I've found more (up-to-date) resources to pull information from and learned new techniques which i'm going to apply here. Time prevents me from working a lot on the project, but if there's going to be updates, its going to be here.
